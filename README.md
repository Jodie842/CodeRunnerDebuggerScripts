# CodeRunnerDebuggerScripts
CodeRunnerDebuggerScripts

Customised debugger scripts for CodeRunner4 for macOS.

These scripts replace/add to the .crDebugger packages under ~/Library/Application Support/CodeRunner/Debuggers/

CodeRunner4 does not include debugger support for Rust, and will prompt you intstall the Rust debugger, which does not work.

rust-lldb.crDebugger is a modification of lldb.crDebugger and uses rust-lldb.

Add this package to ~/Library/Application Support/CodeRunner/Debuggers and the debugger should just work.
