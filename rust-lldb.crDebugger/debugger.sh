#!/bin/bash
#
# This is a CodeRunner debugger script. CodeRunner uses this script to set up a debug
# session, in addition to mapping commands to those used by a specific debugger.
# 
# When starting a debug session, the script is invoked exactly once with the option
# "debugger-server" and thereafter once with the option "debugger-client". With the
# option "debugger-server", the script should establish the debugging session, with
# stdin/stdout being that of the program being run. With the option "debugger-client",
# the script should connect to the already running debugger-server instance, and here
# stdin/stdout is used to interface with the debugger, using various commands.
# 
# The script will be called with the following arguments:
#
# Running the code/debugger:
# 
#	debugger-server		Establish a debug session.
#	debugger-client		Establish a shell connection to the debugger-server instance.
#
# Regular expressions used in debugging:
#
#	prompt-pattern		Output a regex for the prompt string used by the debugger.
#	message-pattern		Optionally output a regex that if matched by an output line
#						from the debugger-client, is displayed in CodeRunner's console.
#	termination-pattern	Optionally output a regex that matches a termination message.
#						Use the regex's first capture group for the exit status.
#	ignore-pattern		Optionally output a regex that if matched by an output line from the
#						debugger-server, prevents the line from being sent to the console.
#
# Commands used to interface with the debugger:
#
#	launch				Output the command used to launch the debugged program after setup.
#	continue			Output the command used to continue execution of a paused program.
#	pause				Output the command used to pause or interrupt execution.
#	breakpoint-set		Output the command used to set a breakpoint in file $2 at line $3.
#	breakpoint-clear	Output the command used to clear breakpoint in file $2 at line $3.
#	step-over			Output the command used to step over the current line of execution.
#	step-in				Output the command used to step into the current line of execution.
#	step-out			Output the command used to step to the end of the current frame.
#	where				Output the command used to get details of the current code location.
#	variables			Output the command used to get details of local variables.
#	print				Output the command used to print a description of expression $2.
#	set					Output the command used to set the value of expression $2 to $3.
#	watch				Output the command used to set a watchpoint for variable $2.
#	select-frame		Output the command used to select the current frame. Arguments:
#							$2 = target frame number, $3 = target thread name,
#							$4 = current frame number, $5 = current thread name
#
# Parsing debugger data:
#
#	where-parse		Read from stdin the debugger's output from the "where" command, and
#					parse it to JSON format to be read by CodeRunner's user interface.
#	variables-parse	Read from stdin the debugger's output from the "variables" command, and
#					parse it to JSON format to be read by CodeRunner's user interface.
#
# CodeRunner debugger options:
#
#	options			Output various options affecting CodeRunner's debugger behavior.
